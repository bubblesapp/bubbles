# Bubbles

**Bubbles helps you resume normal social interactions after a health crisis.**

In the context of a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governments asked citizens to practice social distancing in order to mitigate virus spread and avoid overflooding the healthcare system. After the crisis peaked, it is everyone's aspiration to resume normal social interactions. Bubbles helps users do so in a considerate, progressive and coordinated way, to lower the risk of starting secondary waves of contamination.

>## Project status
>
>Bubbles is a proof-of-concept project to offer an alternative to GPS and/or Bluetooth tracking. It puts users in control of getting their social lives back and relies on a community of people caring for each other.

## Concept

Users create their bubble by choosing a few other users they decide to resume normal social interactions with. Everytime they meet someone from their bubble, they keep track of it in the app. If a user gets sick, he pops his bubble and the information is *anonymously* passed on to other potentially affected bubbles where users might be at risk.

## Start safe

The concept works best if users creating a bubble do it when they are pretty sure they are not a potential vector for the virus. This can happen after a long enough period of social distancing, a negative test, etc. Not showing symptoms doesn't mean you can't infect someone.

## Network of bubbles

Bubbles are not isolated. They touch and mix. If Bob is part of Alice's bubble, and Charlie is part of Bob's but not Alice's, Charlie getting sick can still mean Alice is at risk. Bubbles' algorithm follows the network of bubbles to notify people they might be at risk, taking into account the last time users met and the virus' incubation period.

## What if I'm at risk?

When bubbles pop around a user and they might be at risk, the app recommends they take measures to make sure they're still safe, such as taking a test, or starting a new, long enough period of social distancing. This will help prevent them passing on the virus if they indeed got infected. When the user is once again pretty sure they're safe, a new bubble can be created.

## Expand

As time passes, bubbles that don't pop can be expanded as new users are added to them. This should be done in a careful and progressive way, as bigger bubbles mean more interaction, and a bigger chance to be, or put someone at risk.

## Word of warning

Bubbles is a tool to help resume normal social interactions, **when and where it is allowed**. It doesn't exempt it's users from strictly adhering to all measures imposed by authorities.
